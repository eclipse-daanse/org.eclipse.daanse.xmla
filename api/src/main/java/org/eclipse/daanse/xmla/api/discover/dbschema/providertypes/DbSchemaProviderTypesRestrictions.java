     * @return This enumeration is the same as LEVEL_DBTYPE for MDSCHEMA_LEVELS. The type of the member
     *         key column that is used for the level attribute. It MUST be null if concatenated keys are
     *         used as the member key column. Type values are described in the following list: 0 –
     *         (DBTYPE_EMPTY) Indicates that no value was specified. 2 – (DBTYPE_I2) Indicates a
     *         two-byte signed integer. 3 – (DBTYPE_I4) Indicates a four-byte signed integer. 4 –
     *         (DBTYPE_R4) Indicates a single- precision floating-point value. 5 – (DBTYPE_R8) Indicates
     *         a double- precision floating-point value. 6 – (DBTYPE_CY) Indicates a currency value.
     *         Currency is a fixed-point number with four digits to the right of the decimal point and
     *         is stored in an eight-byte signed integer scaled by 10,000. 7 – (DBTYPE_DATE) Indicates a
     *         date value. Date values are stored as Double, the whole part of which is the number of
     *         days since December 30, 1899, and the fractional part of which is the fraction of a day.
     *         8 – (DBTYPE_BSTR) A pointer to a BSTR, which is a null-terminated character string in
     *         which the string length is stored with the string. 9 – (DBTYPE_IDISPATCH) Indicates a
     *         pointer to an IDispatch interface on an OLE object. 10 – (DBTYPE_ERROR) Indicates a
     *         32-bit error code. 11 – (DBTYPE_BOOL) Indicates a Boolean value. 12 – (DBTYPE_VARIANT)
     *         Indicates an Automation variant. 13 – (DBTYPE_IUNKNOWN) Indicates a pointer to an
     *         IUnknown interface on an OLE object. 14 – (DBTYPE_DECIMAL) Indicates an exact numeric
     *         value with a fixed precision and scale. The scale is between 0 and 28. 16 – (DBTYPE_I1)
     *         Indicates a one-byte signed integer. 17 – (DBTYPE_UI1) Indicates a one-byte unsigned
     *         integer. 18 – (DBTYPE_UI2) Indicates a two-byte unsigned integer. 19 – (DBTYPE_UI4)
     *         Indicates a four-byte unsigned integer. 20 – (DBTYPE_I8) Indicates an eight-byte signed
     *         integer. 21 – (DBTYPE_UI8) Indicates an eight-byte unsigned integer. 72 – (DBTYPE_GUID)
     *         Indicates a GUID. 128 – (DBTYPE_BYTES) Indicates a binary value. 129 – (DBTYPE_STR)
     *         Indicates a string value. 130 – (DBTYPE_WSTR) Indicates a null- terminated Unicode
     *         character string. 131 – (DBTYPE_NUMERIC) Indicates an exact numeric value with a fixed
     *         precision and scale. The scale is between 0 and 38. 132 – (DBTYPE_UDT) Indicates a
     *         user-defined variable. 133 – (DBTYPE_DBDATE) Indicates a date value (yyyymmdd). 134 –
     *         (DBTYPE_DBTIME) Indicates a time value (hhmmss). 135 – (DBTYPE_DBTIMESTAMP) Indicates a
     *         date-time stamp (yyyymmddhhmmss plus a fraction in billionths). 136 - (DBTYPE_HCHAPTER)
     *         Indicates a four-byte chapter value used to identify rows in a child rowset.
